# [Modern Django Blog]

## üåü Modern Django Blog Platform

A fully functional, optimized, and extensible blog application built with Django. This platform provides essential blogging features including structured content, advanced filtering, and efficient content retrieval.

## ‚ú® Features

This blog application includes the following key features:

* **Optimized Querying:** Uses **`select_related()`** and **`prefetch_related()`** in list views to efficiently retrieve related data (Category, Author, Tags) and minimize database queries (solving the N+1 problem).
* **Search Functionality:** Implements fuzzy search via **`Q` objects** across post **Title** and **Content**.
* **Advanced Filtering:** Dedicated views and clean URLs for filtering posts by:
    * Category (using slugs)
    * Tag (using slugs)
    * Author (using usernames)
* **Pagination Persistence:** Implemented using Django's Paginator, ensuring the **search query or active filter** is preserved when navigating between pages.
* **Post Detail View:** Displays rich HTML content (using `|safe`), author information, a view counter, and dynamically retrieved **related posts**.
* **Account Setup:** Initial views and URLs for user account management (`accounts` app).
* **Clean URL Structure:** Uses slugs for posts, categories, and tags for SEO-friendly URLs.
